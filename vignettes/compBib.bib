abstract = {Group-level variance estimates of zero often arise when fitting multilevel or hierarchical linear models, especially when the number of groups is small. For situations where zero variances are implausible a priori, we propose a maximum penalized likelihood approach to avoid such boundary estimates. This approach is equivalent to estimating variance parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly informative prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the log-gamma family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default log-gamma(2,{\$}\backslashlambda{\$}) penalty with {\$}\backslashlambda{\$}{\{}$\backslash$textrightarrow{\}}0, which ensures that the maximum penalized likelihood estimate is approximately one standard error from zero when the maximum likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining consistent with the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that the maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default penalty is a good approximation to the posterior median obtained under a noninformative prior.},

A subset of MS quantification methods (e.g., SILAC and label-free) monitor the relative intensity of intact peptides, where thousands of measurements can be made from a single mass spectrum. An alternative approach, isobaric labeling, enables precise quantification of multiple samples simultaneously through unique and sample specific mass reporter ions. Consequently, in a single scan, the quantitative signal comes from a limited number of spectral features (≤11). The signal observed for these features is constrained by automatic gain control, forcing codependence of concurrent signals. The study of constrained outcomes primarily belongs to the field of compositional data analysis.

abstract = {Isobaric labeling is a powerful strategy for quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic investigations. A complication of such analyses has been the co-isolation of multiple analytes of similar mass-to-charge resulting in the distortion of relative protein abundance measurements across samples. When properly implemented, synchronous precursor selection and triple-stage mass spectrometry (SPS-MS3) can reduce the occurrence of this phenomenon, referred to as ion interference. However, no diagnostic tool is available currently to rapidly and accurately assess ion interference. To address this need, we developed a multiplexed tandem mass tag (TMT)-based standard, termed the triple knockout (TKO). This standard is comprised of three yeast proteomes in triplicate, each from a strain deficient in a highly abundant protein (Met6, Pfk2, or Ura2). The relative abundance patterns of these proteins, which can be inferred from dozens of peptide measurements can demonstrate ion interference in peptide quantification. We expect no signal in channels where the protein is knocked out, permitting maximum sensitivity for measurements of ion interference against a null background. Here, we emphasize the need to investigate further ion interference-generated ratio distortion and promote the TKO standard as a tool to investigate such issues. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model system for investigating biological processes. Cellular events are known to be dysregulated due to shifts in carbon sources. However, the comprehensive proteomic alterations thereof have not been fully investigated. Here we examined proteomic alterations in S. cerevisiae due to the adaptation of yeast from glucose to nine different carbon sources - maltose, trehalose, fructose, sucrose, glycerol, acetate, pyruvate, lactic acid, and oleate. Isobaric tag-based mass spectrometry techniques are at the forefront of global proteomic investigations. As such, we used a TMT10-plex strategy to study multiple growth conditions in a single experiment. The SPS-MS3 method on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer enabled the quantification of over 5000 yeast proteins across ten carbon sources at a 1{\%} protein-level FDR. On average, the proteomes of yeast cultured in fructose and sucrose deviated the least from those cultured in glucose. As expected, gene ontology classification revealed the major alteration in protein abundances occurred in metabolic pathways and mitochondrial proteins. Our protocol lays the groundwork for further investigation of carbon source-induced protein alterations. Additionally, these data offer a hypothesis-generating resource for future studies aiming to investigate both characterized and uncharacterized genes. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE We investigate the proteomic alterations in S. cerevisiae resulting from adaptation of yeast from glucose to nine different carbon sources - maltose, trehalose, fructose, sucrose, glycerol, acetate, pyruvate, lactic acid, and oleate. SPS-MS3 TMT10plex analysis is used for quantitative proteomic analysis. We showcase a technique that allows the quantification of over 5000 yeast proteins, the highest number to date in S. cerevisiae, across 10 growth conditions in a single experiment. As expected, gene ontology classification of proteins with the major alterations in abundances occurred in metabolic pathways and mitochondrial proteins, reflecting the degree of metabolic stress when cellular machinery shifts from growth on glucose to an alternative carbon source. Our protocol lays the groundwork for further investigation of carbon source-induced protein alterations. Improving depth of coverage - measuring abundance changes of over 5000 proteins - increases our understanding of difficult-to-study genes in the model system S. cerevisiae and by homology human cell biology. We submit this highly comprehensive dataset as a hypothesis generating resource for targeted studies on uncharacterized genes.},

We used a series of tandem mass tag 10-plex experiments to analyze the effect of two MEK inhibitors (GSK1120212 and PD0325901) on three tissues (kidney, liver, and pancreas) from nine mice. We quantified ∼ 6000 proteins in each tissue, but significant protein-level alterations were minimal with inhibitor treatment. Of particular interest was kidney tissue, as edema is an adverse effect of these inhibitors. From kidney tissue, we enriched phosphopeptides using titanium dioxide (TiO2 ) and quantified 10 562 phosphorylation events. Further analysis by phosphotyrosine peptide immunoprecipitation quantified an additional 592 phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation motif analysis revealed that the inhibitors decreased phosphorylation levels of proline-x-serine-proline (PxSP) and serine-proline (SP) sites, consistent with extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibition. The MEK inhibitors had the greatest decrease on the phosphorylation of two proteins, Barttin and Slc12a3, which have roles in ion transport and fluid balance. Further studies will provide insight into the effect of these MEK inhibitors with respect to edema and other adverse events in mouse models and human patients.},

We quantified 8590 proteins across all cell lines. Of these, nicotine increased the abundance of 31 proteins 1.5-fold or greater in all cell lines. Likewise, considering proteins with altered levels in at least three of the four cell lines, 64 were up-regulated, while one was down-regulated. Gene ontology analysis revealed that ∼40{\%} of these proteins were membrane bound, and functioned in transmembrane signaling and receptor activity. We highlighted proteins, including APP, APLP2, LAPTM4B, and NCOA4, which were dysregulated by nicotine in all cell lines investigated and may have implications in downstream signaling pathways, particularly autophagy.

abstract = {Multiplexed quantitation via isobaric chemical tags (e.g., tandem mass tags (TMT) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)) has the potential to revolutionize quantitative proteomics. However, until recently the utility of these tags was questionable due to reporter ion ratio distortion resulting from fragmentation of coisolated interfering species. These interfering signals can be negated through additional gas-phase manipulations (e.g., MS/MS/MS (MS3) and proton-transfer reactions (PTR)). These methods, however, have a significant sensitivity penalty. Using isolation waveforms with multiple frequency notches (i.e., synchronous precursor selection, SPS), we coisolated and cofragmented multiple MS2 fragment ions, thereby increasing the number of reporter ions in the MS3 spectrum 10-fold over the standard MS3 method (i.e., MultiNotch MS3). By increasing the reporter ion signals, this method improves the dynamic range of reporter ion quantitation, reduces reporter ion signal variance, and ultimately produces more high-quality quantitative measurements. To demonstrate utility, we analyzed biological triplicates of eight colon cancer cell lines using the MultiNotch MS3 method. Across all the replicates we quantified 8,378 proteins in union and 6,168 proteins in common. Taking into account that each of these quantified proteins contains eight distinct cell-line measurements, this data set encompasses 174,704 quantitative ratios each measured in triplicate across the biological replicates. Herein, we demonstrate that the MultiNotch MS3 method uniquely combines multiplexing capacity with quantitative sensitivity and accuracy, drastically increasing the informational value obtainable from proteomic experiments.},

Comparing protein abundances and phosphorylation levels revealed specialized, interconnected phosphorylation networks within each tissue while suggesting that many proteins are regulated by phosphorylation independently of their expression.

The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort.

abstract = {Labeling of primary amines on peptides with reagents containing stable isotopes is a commonly used technique in quantitative mass spectrometry. Isobaric labeling techniques such as iTRAQ™ or TMT™ allow for relative quantification of peptides based on ratios of reporter ions in the low m/z region of spectra produced by precursor ion fragmentation. In contrast, nonisobaric labeling with mTRAQ™ yields precursors with different masses that can be directly quantified in MS1 spectra. In this study, we compare iTRAQ- and mTRAQ-based quantification of peptides and phosphopeptides derived from EGF-stimulated HeLa cells. Both labels have identical chemical structures, therefore precursor ion- and fragment ion-based quantification can be directly compared. Our results indicate that iTRAQ labeling has an additive effect on precursor intensities, whereas mTRAQ labeling leads to more redundant MS2 scanning events caused by triggering on the same peptide with different mTRAQ labels. We found that iTRAQ labeling quantified nearly threefold more phosphopeptides (12,129 versus 4,448) and nearly twofold more proteins (2,699 versus 1,597) than mTRAQ labeling. Although most key proteins in the EGFR signaling network were quantified with both techniques, iTRAQ labeling allowed quantification of twice as many kinases. Accuracy of reporter ion quantification by iTRAQ is adversely affected by peptides that are cofragmented in the same precursor isolation window, dampening observed ratios toward unity. However, because of tighter overall iTRAQ ratio distributions, the percentage of statistically significantly regulated phosphopeptides and proteins detected by iTRAQ and mTRAQ was similar. We observed a linear correlation of logarithmic iTRAQ to mTRAQ ratios over two orders of magnitude, indicating a possibility to correct iTRAQ ratios by an average compression factor. Spike-in experiments using peptides of defined ratios in a background of nonregulated peptides show that iTRAQ quantification is less accurate but not as variable as mTRAQ quantification.},

Label-free quantification strategies do not suffer from such an accuracy bias but cannot be multiplexed and are less precise. Here, we compared protein quantification results obtained with these methods for a chemoproteomic competition binding experiment and evaluated the utility of measures of spectrum purity in survey spectra for estimating the impact of cofragmentation on measured TMT-ratios. While applying stringent interference filters enables substantially more accurate TMT quantification, this came at the expense of 30{\%}-60{\%} fewer proteins quantified. We devised an algorithm that corrects experimental TMT ratios on the basis of determined peptide interference levels. The quantification accuracy achieved with this correction was comparable to that obtained with stringent spectrum filters but limited the loss in coverage to {\textless}10{\%}. The generic applicability of the fold change correction algorithm was further demonstrated by spiking of chemoproteomics samples into excess amounts of E. coli tryptic digests.},

@article{Aitchison1982,
abstract = {The simplex plays an important role as sample space in many practical situations where compositional data, in the form of proportions of some whole, require interpretation. It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},
